# WindowsBlockSite
I sincerely want to remind you again that THIS IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY.
Written in batch language.

# How it works
BlockSite.bat edits the data in the "hosts" file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc by adding or removing a line of '0.0.0.0 [host name]' in it.

This file was made for fun only!
