# WindowsBlockSite
I sincerely want to remind you again that THIS IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY.
Written in batch language.

# How it works
BlockSite.bat edits the data in the `hosts` file located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` by adding or removing a line of
`0.0.0.0 [host name]` or `127.0.0.1 [host name]`
in it.

# Download
Download ZIP of the repository by clicking `Clone or download` (the green button, for those who are new to Github). If you are using Linux (I don't know why you want to get this), simply use `$ git clone https://github.com/Saratoga-CV6/WindowsBlockSite`.

This file was made for fun only!
