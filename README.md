# WindowsBlockSite
I sincerely want to remind you again that THIS IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY.
Written in batch language.

# How it works
BlockSite.bat edits the data in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` by searching, adding or removing a line of `0.0.0.0 [host name]` or `127.0.0.1 [host name]` in it.

# Download
## Using GitHub GUI:
Simply click `Clone or download`, then `Download ZIP`.
## From the command line:
Windows: `> start github.com/Saratoga-CV6/WindowsBlockSite/archive/master.zip`.

Linux (I don't know why you want to get this): `$ git clone https://github.com/Saratoga-CV6/WindowsBlockSite`.
